## Aim:
To compare the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design of three popular delivery apps—Zomato, Blinkit, and Swiggy—and identify similarities, differences, and usability patterns across their home screens.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Observe both app interfaces (Amazon and Flipkart) carefully.

Step 2: Identify key elements such as logo, search bar, color scheme, text focus, and navigation style.

Step 3: Break down the design into key sections — header, main content area, and navigation bar.

Step 4: Compare how each app handles categories, offers, and personalization.

Step 5: Summarize the differences in a tabular format.

Step 6: Conclude which app focuses more on user personalization and which emphasizes promotional content.

## Output:
Comparison between Amazon and Flipkart App Interfaces

## Result:
The comparison clearly shows that Amazon focuses on a personalized and simple shopping experience, while Flipkart emphasizes colorful visuals, offers, and faster navigation.
